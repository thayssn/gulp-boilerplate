# Boilerplate

This is my boilerplate for new JS projects. It currently uses node@12.4.0.

## Initializing your project

We can initialize a git repository, install the dependencies needed and setup the configurations for package.json and eslint by running the following command:

```
yarn cook
```

or

```
npm run cook:npm
```
